## Project Overview

The **Habit Tracker MCP** is a Model Context Protocol server that enables AI assistants to help users build and maintain positive habits through intelligent tracking, analytics, and motivation.

### What is Habit Tracking?
Habit tracking is the practice of monitoring behaviors you want to develop into automatic routines. Research shows that tracking increases success rates by:
- Making progress visible
- Creating accountability
- Identifying patterns and triggers
- Building motivation through streaks

### Why an MCP Server?
By implementing this as an MCP server, we enable AI assistants like Claude to:
- Naturally integrate habit tracking into conversations
- Provide contextual motivation and insights
- Generate personalized recommendations
- Make habit tracking feel conversational rather than administrative

---

## Goals and Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Simplify Habit Formation**: Make it easy to start tracking any habit
2. **Provide Insights**: Generate meaningful analytics about habit patterns
3. **Maintain Motivation**: Use streaks and achievements to encourage consistency
4. **Enable AI Integration**: Allow seamless interaction through conversational AI

### Success Metrics
- Users can create and log habits within 30 seconds
- System provides actionable insights after 1 week of data
- Streak calculations motivate continued engagement
- AI can naturally discuss habits and progress

## User Stories

### Core User Stories

**Story 1: Getting Started**
> As a user wanting to build better habits, I want to easily define what I want to track, so that I can start building consistency.

**Story 2: Daily Logging**
> As someone working on habits, I want to quickly log my daily activities with optional notes, so that I can track progress without friction.

**Story 3: Progress Tracking**
> As a habit tracker, I want to see my current streaks and recent activity, so that I can stay motivated and see my progress.

**Story 4: Pattern Recognition**
> As someone improving my life, I want to understand which habits work well together, so that I can optimize my routine.

**Story 5: Motivation and Recovery**
> As someone who sometimes misses days, I want encouragement and strategies to get back on track, so that I don't give up entirely.

### Advanced User Stories

**Story 6: Habit Evolution**
> As my routine matures, I want to modify habit frequency or intensity, so that my tracking evolves with my lifestyle.

**Story 7: Category Analysis**
> As someone tracking multiple life areas, I want to see how different categories (health, productivity, social) are performing relative to each other.

## Domain Model

### Core Entities

#### 1. Habit
A habit represents something the user wants to do regularly.

```rust
pub struct Habit {
    pub id: HabitId,           // Unique identifier
    pub name: HabitName,       // "Morning Run", "Read for 30min"
    pub description: Option<String>, // Optional detailed description
    pub category: Category,     // health, productivity, social, etc.
    pub frequency: Frequency,   // How often it should be done
    pub target_value: Option<u32>, // Optional numeric target (minutes, reps)
    pub unit: Option<String>,   // "minutes", "pages", "reps"
    pub created_at: DateTime<Utc>,
    pub is_active: bool,       // Can be paused/disabled
}
```

#### 2. HabitEntry
A record of completing a habit on a specific day.

```rust
pub struct HabitEntry {
    pub id: EntryId,
    pub habit_id: HabitId,
    pub logged_at: DateTime<Utc>,    // When the entry was created
    pub completed_at: Date<Utc>,     // Which day this was completed
    pub value: Option<u32>,          // Actual amount (if habit has target)
    pub intensity: Option<u8>,       // Subjective rating 1-10
    pub notes: Option<String>,       // User's notes about this completion
}
```

#### 3. Streak
Calculated streak information for a habit.

```rust
pub struct Streak {
    pub habit_id: HabitId,
    pub current_streak: u32,         // Current consecutive days
    pub longest_streak: u32,         // Best streak ever achieved
    pub last_completed: Option<Date<Utc>>,
    pub total_completions: u32,      // All-time completion count
    pub completion_rate: f64,        // Percentage since habit creation
}
```

### Supporting Types

#### Frequency
How often a habit should be performed.

```rust
pub enum Frequency {
    Daily,                    // Every day
    Weekly(u8),              // X times per week (1-7)
    Weekdays,                // Monday through Friday only  
    Weekends,                // Saturday and Sunday only
    Custom(Vec<Weekday>),    // Specific days of week
    Interval(u32),           // Every N days
}
```

#### Category
Broad areas of life for organizing habits.

```rust
pub enum Category {
    Health,        // Exercise, diet, sleep
    Productivity,  // Work, learning, organization
    Social,        // Relationships, communication
    Creative,      // Art, writing, music
    Mindfulness,   // Meditation, reflection, gratitude
    Financial,     // Budgeting, investing, spending tracking
    Household,     // Cleaning, maintenance, organization
    Personal,      // Hobbies, self-care, personal growth
    Custom(String), // User-defined category
}
```

### Validation Rules

#### Habit Validation
- `name`: 1-100 characters, non-empty
- `frequency`: Must be valid enum value
- `target_value`: If present, must be > 0
- `unit`: If present, 1-20 characters

#### HabitEntry Validation
- `completed_at`: Cannot be in future
- `value`: If habit has target, value should be reasonable (0-10x target)
- `intensity`: Must be 1-10 if present
- `notes`: Max 500 characters

## Analytics and Insights

### Streak Calculation Logic

#### Basic Streak Rules
1. **Daily Habits**: Streak breaks if missed for 24+ hours
2. **Weekly Habits**: Streak continues as long as weekly target is met
3. **Custom Frequency**: Streak based on scheduled days only

#### Grace Period System
- **Sick Days**: User can mark days as "sick" to maintain streak
- **Travel Mode**: Reduced frequency during travel periods
- **Flexible Streaks**: Allow 1 miss per 7 days for daily habits

### Pattern Recognition

#### Correlation Analysis
- **Habit Chains**: Identify habits that often happen together
- **Time Patterns**: When during day/week are habits most successful
- **Environmental Factors**: Day of week, season, etc.

#### Insight Types

1. **Performance Insights**
   - "You're most consistent on Mondays" 
   - "Your completion rate improves when you log in the morning"
   - "Habits with targets have 23% higher completion rates"

2. **Behavioral Insights**
   - "When you complete A, you're X% more likely to complete B"
   - "Your intensity scores are highest on weekends"
   - "You tend to skip habits after 3+ consecutive days"

3. **Motivational Insights**  
   - "You're 2 days away from your longest streak!"
   - "This week's completion rate is 15% above your average"
   - "You've completed habits 23 days this month - personal record!"

### Recommendation Engine

#### Smart Suggestions
- **Habit Stacking**: Suggest pairing new habits with established ones
- **Optimal Timing**: Recommend best times based on historical data
- **Frequency Adjustment**: Suggest frequency changes based on performance

#### Recovery Strategies
- **Streak Recovery**: "Start with just 5 minutes to rebuild momentum"
- **Pattern Breaking**: "Try doing this habit at a different time"
- **Simplification**: "Consider reducing the target from 30 to 15 minutes"

## Data Storage

### Storage Requirements

#### Data Persistence
- **Local Storage**: SQLite database for local-first approach
- **Cross-Session**: Data survives server restarts
- **Backup Ready**: Easy to export/import data

#### Performance Considerations
- **Read Heavy**: Most operations are queries (status, insights)
- **Small Dataset**: Even power users unlikely to exceed 10MB
- **Simple Queries**: Mostly single-table or simple joins

### Database Schema

#### Tables

**habits**
```sql
CREATE TABLE habits (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    category TEXT NOT NULL,
    frequency_type TEXT NOT NULL,  -- 'daily', 'weekly', etc.
    frequency_data TEXT,           -- JSON for complex frequencies
    target_value INTEGER,
    unit TEXT,
    created_at TEXT NOT NULL,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE
);
```

**habit_entries**
```sql
CREATE TABLE habit_entries (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    habit_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    logged_at TEXT NOT NULL,
    completed_at TEXT NOT NULL,     -- Date only (YYYY-MM-DD)
    value INTEGER,
    intensity INTEGER,
    notes TEXT,
    FOREIGN KEY (habit_id) REFERENCES habits (id)
);
```

**habit_streaks** (calculated/cached)
```sql
CREATE TABLE habit_streaks (
    habit_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    current_streak INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    longest_streak INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    last_completed TEXT,
    total_completions INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    updated_at TEXT NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (habit_id) REFERENCES habits (id)
);
```

#### Indexes
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_habit_entries_habit_completed ON habit_entries (habit_id, completed_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_habit_entries_completed_at ON habit_entries (completed_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_habits_category ON habits (category);
```
